# Fawkes on Google Colab

This project shows how to run **Fawkes**, the privacy tool from the University of Chicago SAND Lab, directly in Google Colab using a Jupyter Notebook. The goal is to make it easy to cloak images so they can't be used to train facial recognition models.

## Features
- Runs entirely on Google Colab
- Optional GPU support for faster processing
- Simple, step-by-step notebook
- Supports different Fawkes cloaking modes

## How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Colab
2. Follow the steps
3. Upload the images you want to cloak  
4. Pick a cloaking mode (low / mid / high)  
5. Run the notebook cells  
6. Download your cloaked images
